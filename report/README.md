# Kaggle Data Competition

## Introduction

The goal of this Kaggle data competition is, “to learn how to use machine learning algorithms, and gain understanding about them…<through> bird species classification.” In this paper, I describe the progression from the very beginning, extracting features using tensorflow on Amazon Web Services (AWS), through my explorations into several various models and data manipulation, eventually ending with the understanding gained through the data competition and further research that could be performed to potentially improve classification using images.
